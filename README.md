# Flutter BLoC Tutorial

This repository contains a simple Flutter application demonstrating the use of the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern for state management. The app includes a counter and a theme toggler, showcasing how to manage state using BLoC, `BlocBuilder`, `BlocListener`, and `BlocConsumer`.

## Features

- **Counter BLoC**: Manages an integer value and allows incrementing and decrementing the counter.
- **Theme BLoC**: Toggles between light and dark themes, changing the primary color from blue (light theme) to green (dark theme).
- **BlocBuilder**: Updates the UI whenever the counter value changes.
- **BlocListener**: Shows a SnackBar when the counter reaches a specific value (e.g., 5).
- **BlocConsumer**: Combines `BlocBuilder` and `BlocListener` in a single widget.
